BUT I SUPPOSE IT IS OFTEN THAT WAY. THE BRAVE THINGS IN THE OLD TALES AND SONGS IS ADVENTURES, AS I USED TO CALL THEM. I USED TO THINK THAT THEY WERE THINGS THE WONDERFUL FOLK OF THE STORIES WENT OUT AND LOOKED FOR, BECAUSE THEY WANTED THEM, BECAUSE THEY WERE EXCITING AND LIFE WAS A BIT DULL, A KIND OF A SPORT, AS YOU MIGHT SAY. BUT THAT IS NOT THE WAY OF IT WITH THE TALES THAT REALLY MATTERED, OR THE ONES THAT STAY IN THE MIND. FOLK SEEM TO HAVE BEEN JUST LANDED IN THEM, USUALLY - THEIR PATHS WERE LAID THAT WAY, AS YOU PUT IT. BUT I EXPECT THEY HAD LOTS OF CHANCES, LIKE US, OF TURNING BACK, ONLY THEY DID NOT. AND IF THEY HAD, WE SHOULD NOT KNOW, BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN. WE HEAR ABOUT THOSE AS JUST WENT ON - AND NOT ALL TO A GOOD END CRYPTO{NOT_A_SUBSTITUTION_CIPHER}, MIND YOU. AT LEAST NOT TO WHAT FOLK INSIDE A STORY AND NOT OUTSIDE IT CALL A GOOD END. YOU KNOW, COMING HOME, AND FINDING THINGS ALL RIGHT, THOUGH NOT QUITE THE SAME - LIKE OLD MR. BILBO. BUT THOSE ARE NOT ALWAYS THE BEST TALES TO HEAR, THOUGH THEY MAY BE THE BEST TALES TO GET LANDED IN.
